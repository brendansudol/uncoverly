I recommend gentle hand washing for these stakes and to store them inside during the cold winter, so to keep them as beautiful as the day they arrive to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeed more garden and home ceramics?\r\nHere they are:\r\nhttp://www.etsy.com/shop/RossLab?section_id=10342483\r\n\r\n\r\nBy purchasing this item you agree to my shop\u2019s policies, so please take time to read them:\r\nhttp://etsy.me/VSYMCi\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\nFor more RossLab goodies:\r\nhttp://www.etsy.com/shop/RossLab\r\n\r\n. . . \r\nCopyright \u00a9 2011-2014 RossLab", "views": 10059, "item_weight": null, "item_width": null, "who_made": "i_did", "category_path_ids": [68887346, 69153219], "file_data": "", "recipient": null, "tags": ["Teamprojectt", "Garden Stakes", "Herbs Labels", "White Hearts", "Gardening", "Chalkboard", "Love", "Herb Markers", "Vegetable Garden", "Home Decor", "Valentine", "Mothers Day"], "category_path": ["Plants and Edibles", "Plant"], "non_taxable": false, "ending_tsz": 1436108420, "is_supply": "false", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://www.etsy.com/listing/107629685/chalkboard-garden-markers-herb-stakes?utm_source=brendansudol&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api", "when_made": "2010_2016", "materials": ["clay", "glaze"], "item_dimensions_unit": null, "currency_code": "USD", "occasion": null, "category_id": 69153219, "item_weight_units": null, "featured_rank": null, "quantity": 1}, {"num_favorers": 3800, "image": "https://img0.etsystatic.com/043/0/6328095/il_340x270.602668796_62xa.jpg", "creation_tsz": 1456175709, "taxonomy_id": 1002, "style": ["Modern", "Industrial"], "item_length": null, "has_variations": true, "original_creation_tsz": 1325084339, "shop_section_id": 10895620, "used_manufacturer": false, "listing_id": 89300562, "user_id": 14775367, "processing_min": 10, "title": "The Gibson Mailbox - Custom", "processing_max": 15, "taxonomy_path": ["Home & Living", "Home D\u00e9cor"], "views": 44726, "last_modified_tsz": 1456175709, "state": "active", "is_digital": false, "shipping_template_id": null, "is_customizable": false, "item_height": null, "state_tsz": 1450828701, "description": "PRODUCT DESCRIPTION ----------------------------------------------------\n\nOur Gibson Custom mailbox -- our most popular design --  can be customized with up to five numbers (we offer our Gibson Classic if your mailbox does not need customization; please see the listing here: https://www.etsy.com/listing/96833456/the-gibson-mailbox-classic? ). The face plate is composed of 1/4&quot; steel, and the sides are made of 14 gauge steel to provide utility and keep the overall weight of the mailbox down. The numbers on the face of the mailbox measure 3&quot; in height. Please scroll through the pictures above to see the dimensions.\n\nThis mailbox is designed to be a wall-mount mailbox, with protection from direct rain or snow. We do not recommend this mailbox be mounted on a gate, fence, or post as there are mounting holes in the back which prevent the mailbox from being fully waterproof with direct exposure to the elements.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: we are only able to offer customization with your house numbers; unfortunately, we cannot do last names or other words on the mailbox.\n\nWEATHERING --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs with all of our products, the raw steel will eventually develop a brown patina over time with natural weathering. The rate at which this rusting happens varies with exposure to the elements and climate. You can forestall this process (but not eliminate it altogether) by treating your item with a clear coat product such as a Rustoleum spray product from your local hardware store. Each product will require multiple treatments over time to avoid and delay the natural rust process, though neither will guarantee a 100% rust free surface. \n\nPURCHASING INFORMATION -------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen ordering, please choose a font style (please refer to the chart above to the four different options. Also, please list your house numbers in the &quot;notes&quot; section upon checkout. Please allow 2-3 weeks fabrication time. Upon completion, we will send you shipping notification and tracking information. \n\n***  Live in Austin? Save on shipping!

The print is designed to float in a standard sized frame with a thin white border. Printed on Archival Fine Art Paper. The colors of the actual print are richer and more vibrant than this web image.

This fine art photograph will be printed on acid-free photographic paper using archival inks that are rich in color and will resist fading for 100+ years. The paper has a gorgeous metallic finish that has a uniquely vibrant look. Its pearlescent gloss yields a dramatic iridescence and makes colors positively shimmer, giving an almost luminescent quality to the print. Prints that are shipped from Montreal are signed on the back.\n\nPlease note that the colors you see on your monitor may differ slightly from those of the print due to variations in monitor settings. \n\nCUSTOM ORDERS are welcome if you need a print in a size that is not listed or if you have any other special requests.

Deliberately &#39;de-focused&#39; both in camera and in post-processing, to produce an image which captures the beauty of the English landscape and typically dramatic northern sky with an almost painting-like quality.\r\n\r\nThe title refers to the 400th anniversary of the Lancashire Witch Trials, in which the &#39;Pendle Witches&#39; were tried and subsequently executed. \r\n\r\nTitle: The Shadows of 1612\r\nArtist: Justice Hyde\r\nDate: 2012\r\nLocation: Pendle, Northwest UK\r\n\r\nComing in a very limited edition of 25 prints across all sizes and finishes, each print is individually hand-signed and numbered. The print you receive will of course not have the copyright watermark.\r\n\r\nThe photograph is available either as unmounted prints in a range of sizes from 12x8 inches [30x20cm approx.] to 24x16 inches [61x41cm approx.], and also in ready-to-hang options of 18x12 inch [46x30cm approx.] traditional gallery wrap canvas or modern aluminium mounting. All are produced by an award-winning lab using only the finest quality materials.\r\n\r\nPlease select the size and finish you require at top right.\r\n\r\nUnmounted prints come on Hahnem\u00fchle FineArt Pearl 285 g/m\u00b2 paper, printed with Epson Ultrachrome K3 pigment inks for true museum quality and colourfastness certified for 100 years. These are absolutely the finest quality prints to be found, used by professional photographers when only the best will do, and loved by art collectors for their stunning detail in highlight and shadow as well as depth of tone. 12x8, 15x10 and 18x12 prints come with an additional 0.39&quot; [1cm] white border for easy matting and framing. 24x16 prints come with a 0.79&quot; [2cm] border.\r\n\r\nGallery wrap canvas prints are produced using the same Epson K3 inks as my paper prints, on heavyweight 100% cotton canvas, to create pieces with richness and luminosity along with a wonderfully tactile texture. They are stretched onto a a 0.79&quot; [2cm] frame made from sustainable spruce wood, reinforced for stability and fitted with robust metal corners for easy hanging\r\n\r\nAluminium mounting is the ultimate ready-to-hang enhancement to your home decor, a spectacular image and a sleek and modern mounting system which creates a stunning piece of gallery standard artwork. The photograph is professionally lab-printed onto Fuji Crystal Archive DPII paper using a traditional photo-chemical process, then mounted and sealed on a 3 layer aluminium substrate (for superb stability and warp-resistance). Finally, a UV-protective coating is applied to protect the print. Wall-fixings are pre-fitted, so the piece is ready to hang straight away.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that quality of this kind takes a little time. Turnaraound times vary from 7 business days for unmounted prints to 10 business days on average for canvas and aluminium mounting, after which I take delivery of the work for inspection before shipping to you. Guaranteed to be worth the wait!\r\n\r\nPrices include worldwide shipping.\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t see the size and/or finish you want?

No peeling, no glue residue, no worries.\n\u2022 Unlike decals, stenciling is easy to touch-up, adjust or re-do. With most decals you get 1 chance to install it right.\n\u2022 No artistic ability is needed to use a stencil.  Plus you get the satisfaction of producing beautiful wall art. Even beginners get great results!\n\u2022 Super economical! Stenciling is more cost effective than wallpaper, decals or faux finishes.\n\u2022 Works on textured walls, floors, ceilings, furniture and fabric  (see below for more detailed info).\n\u2022 Detailed Stenciling instructions, color photo and a FREE STENCIL ($4.95 value) included with each order.\n \nImportant information about stenciling on textured walls:\nIn general, it&#39;s possible to stencil over textured surfaces, however it depends on the roughness of your texture and your desired outcome.\n \nSome textures are really rough, with huge &quot;peaks and valleys&quot; and, if this is your case, stenciling may not be an option. However, there are light to medium textures that are very suitable for stenciling. We have stenciled many faux frescoes for customers, and this technique actually requires applying a textured plaster background first and then stenciling on top of it. Of course organic stencil designs such as leaves and branches are more forgiving than designs that have straight lines and perfect edges.\n \nWith textures it is especially important that you put very little paint on your brush and always off-load it onto a paper towel. Use a rubbing/dabbing motion while stenciling and try not to force the paint under the edges of the stencil. You can also use a dense foam roller, but make sure that you off-load it onto some paper towels so that it is relatively dry. To avoid seepage, use very little paint, and don&#39;t press hard on the roller. Using spray adhesive can also help prevent seepage of paint under the stencils. We love Elmer&#39;s re-positionable spray adhesive but most re-positionable spray adhesives are fine. Always test the stencil on a disposable surface first (such as a piece of cardboard), or try stenciling a small area in a corner somewhere and immediately wipe the stenciled paint off the wall with a moist baby wipe. Also, it&#39;s good to remember that using high-contrast colors (like black over white) is much less forgiving than using colors that are similar to each other. Please keep in mind, different paint finishes vary in results. Since each project is unique, we cannot guarantee you will not see bleeding. But please feel free to contact us before you purchase your stencil and we will be happy to assist you in achieving what you are looking for.\n\n \nYou can stencil with acrylic or latex paint, stencil creams or fabric paint of your choice. Use a dense foam roller or stencil brush. (We sell both)\n \nWe find that it is not necessary to use spray adhesive with our stencils. However, if you want crisper edges or are stenciling with high contrasting colors, please use it (Elmer&#39;s spray adhesive seems to be the best). We personally prefer to secure the stencil with pieces of blue painter&#39;s tape, but it may be helpful for beginners to mist a stencil with spray adhesive just to make sure you get great results. \n \nDid you know you can stencil on fabric too? You can create custom stenciled curtains, pillows and tablecloths with our stencils! When stenciling on fabric, stencil adhesive is very helpful. First, tape your ironed fabric to the surface so it doesn&#39;t move around while you stencil. Use stencil brushes, or roller, and add some textile medium (sold in craft stores) to your acrylic paint. You can also get a special fabric paint, but, frankly, good craft acrylics with a dollop of textile medium work just as well, and costs way less too! :) Let the stenciled image dry completely, 24 hours is best, then heat-set it by ironing the fabric for about 20 seconds (more or less) on a LOW setting through a piece of cloth.Heat-setting will cure the paint and prevent it from being washed off in the washing machine. Always experiment with a sample of your fabric first to ensure good results. We&#39;ve stenciled on silk, cotton, linen and even sheer fabrics with great results. It&#39;s always better if your fabric doesn&#39;t have too much texture.\n \nIf you compare our stencil thickness, size, design quality and prices, you will be amazed at the value that Cutting Edge Stencils offer!\n \nOur stencils are made out of durable 12 mil clear plastic stencil material. This material is strong but flexible, reusable and easy to clean. We love it so much more than standard 5-8 mil Mylar! It&#39;s not brittle, it\u2019s user friendly and just so easy to work with. In our many years of professional stenciling, this material has proven to be far superior to any other stencil material we used. Our customers love it too, and we are sure that you&#39;ll notice the difference! Our stencils will last a long time and are a pleasure to use.\n \nOur professional decorative company, Specfin Designs, has been a leader in faux painting for over 20 years in the NYC/NJ Metropolitan area. We have hundreds of original hand drawn designs that we have turned into well-engineered, sturdy stencils that are easy and fun to use. For over 20 years we painted, faux finished, plastered and stenciled in hundreds of upscale homes in the New York Metropolitan area, as well as other locations around the country. So when we say, &quot;We know decorative painting and stenciling,&quot; we really mean it :)\nYou can see many beautiful examples of our work by visiting http://www.specfindesigns.com\n \nYOU ARE WELCOME TO BROWSE OUR EXTENSIVE PORTFOLIO AND USE IT FOR YOUR INSPIRATION!\n \n\nWE COMBINE SHIPPING!

My Growth Charts are one of a kind originals and I aim for the best quality possible when creating these by hand.  I use black acrylic paint and apply with a brush, I do not use paint pens, spray paints or sticker decals (vinyl).  I have taken time distressing and sanding each ruler by hand to make the wood look aged.  This ruler is a finished product, the front and back of the ruler is stained and finished for a complete look. This growth chart is meant to hang 6 inches from the ground despite what the photo shows (a custom order request can be made to alter measurements).  This  growth charts is functional and will last the ever changing environment in your home. This is the perfect way to track your child&#39;s growth and you can even take it with you when you move. \n\nI recommend using a black fine tip sharpie to record your child&#39;s growth.\n\nDETAILS: \n\nCOLOR:  Pottery Brown \n\nWOODEN BOARD DIMENSIONS APPROXIMATELY:\n\n1 inch thick \n10 inches wide \n 6 Feet tall \n\nNEW******* 1 Large STEEL D-Ring Holder by OOK that is SCREWED\n                           into the Growth Chart with 2 SCREWS for safety.  \n\nDIRECTIONS:\n\nHANG 6\u201d OFF OF THE GROUND\n(photo shows it leaning this is meant to hang unless a custom order request is made)\n*I recommend fastening these rulers to the wall after hanging with screws into studs. This will help prevent the rulers from moving and keep the rulers flat against the wall. \n\nAS WITH THE NATURE OF WOOD, EVERY PIECE IS DIFFERENT.  I USE THE SAME EXACT STAIN AND THE SAME METHOD ON EACH PIECE.  NO TWO ARE ALIKE, THE WOOD MAY BE LIGHTER OR SLIGHTLY DARKER THAN THE PHOTO.

It involves locking artwork into the bed of a press, inking it, and rolling or pressing paper against it to form an impression. Every print is individual and unique. From beginning to end, it can be a laborious process but an art-form that allows a true piece of handcrafted art to be crafted. \n\nSHOP THE MEDIUM CONTROL STORE\nhttp://etsy.com/shop/mediumcontrol\n\nSHOP FOR MORE ART PRINTS\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/mediumcontrol?section_id=6855725\n\nFRIENDS SAVE SOME CASH\nLike & Tweet & Pin & Share & Follow THE MEDIUM CONTROL on your favorite social media to SAVE 10%!

In the case of a camera strap, the old clich\u00e9 holds true.\n\nThis camera strap was born from an inability to find the perfect strap. All-leather camera straps proved to be too stiff and bulky. The straps supplied with cameras were out; those only seemed to twist and tangle their way into the shot, while advertising for a camera manufacturer. Nylon straps lacked a soft, rich, classic feel.\n\nA simple, honest strap was what we sought. No extra adjusters for added bulk, and no synthetic materials; only leather, cotton, linen, and metal. Clean and minimal design provides the user with years of honest, hard-working service, and makes for a classic aesthetic that pairs well with many cameras, ranging from a treasured rangefinder to modern DSLR.\n\nAll Northern Strap products are handmade from start-to-finish in Duluth, Minn. Leather ends are sewn with waxed linen thread onto 1&quot; wide heavy grade navy cotton webbing. Nickel-plated buckles close up each end, ensuring the camera is safe and secure. Strap ends are ~.49&quot; wide and fit through slot-type lugs on some cameras as well as most triangular split rings, but round split rings are supplied with each strap for fitment on a wide range of classic and contemporary cameras.\n\nThis strap acquires richness with age, as the leather ends take on patina and cotton webbing breaks in to provide softness and comfort. A handsome addition to one&#39;s own camera, or a long-lasting, useful gift for the photographer loved-one.\n\nPlease specify desired strap length when ordering. If using with a Canon EOS-series camera, please note in order, for proper fitment with these cameras. Lengths are as follows (measured from end-to-end where the strap attaches to the camera):\n\nShort \u2013 40&quot;\nMedium ~45&quot;\nLong ~50&quot;\n\n$5.50 shipping within United States, $10.50 for Canada, and $13.50 worldwide.", "tags": ["camera strap", "leather camera strap", "canon camera strap", "fuji camera strap", "woven camera strap", "vintage look strap", "DSLR camera strap", "kameragurt", "SLR camera strap", "leica camera strap", "classic camera strap", "\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c", "\u0444\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0430\u043f\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430"], "price": "46.00", "item_weight": null, "item_width": null, "who_made": "i_did", "category_path_ids": [69150467], "file_data": "", "recipient": null, "is_private": false, "category_path": ["Accessories"], "non_taxable": false, "ending_tsz": 1467021502, "is_supply": "false", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://www.etsy.com/listing/117469796/classic-leather-camera-strap-vintage?utm_source=brendansudol&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api", "when_made": "made_to_order", "materials": ["leather", "cotton web", "adjustable buckle"], "item_dimensions_unit": "in", "currency_code": "USD", "occasion": null, "category_id": 69150467, "item_weight_units": null, "featured_rank": null, "quantity": 9}, {"image": "https://img1.etsystatic.com/033/0/6491039/il_340x270.526802057_k686.jpg", "creation_tsz": 1445793899, "suggested_taxonomy_id": 574, "style": null, "item_length": null, "has_variations": true, "original_creation_tsz": 1384638195, "shop_section_id": 10344324, "used_manufacturer": false, "listing_id": 169503804, "user_id": 16295664, "processing_min": null, "title": "Art Gallery Fabric - Rapture Collection - Wild Beauty Saffron - Patricia Bravo- Choose Your Cut", "processing_max": null, "taxonomy_path": ["Craft Supplies & Tools", "Fabric"], "num_favorers": 777, "last_modified_tsz": 1452236854, "state": "sold_out", "is_digital": false, "is_private": false, "shipping_template_id": 9081939, "is_customizable": true, "item_height": null, "state_tsz": 1452236854, "description": "New From Art Gallery Fabrics and designer Patricia Bravo\r\n\r\nPart of her Rapture Collection, this beautiful fabric line features gorgeous floral bouquets in lush colors.\r\n\r\nThis print is called Wild Beauty Saffron from the Subtle Joy Palette.

There is nothing trendy about the font: classic Helvetica is used to announce the station name, which means it will never go out of style!  \n\nThe white finish on front has aged into a lovely, creamy ecru color.  The back is unfinished.\n\nThe sign itself appears to be aluminum.  There are bends in the metal on the top and bottom, where the sign angles out perpendicular to the sign.  The bends are not a perfect 90 degree angle, and it looks like they were fixed around a piece of wood or posts that held the sign in place.  Because of these bends, the front of the sign extends 3/4&quot;, so it sits slightly off the wall.  \nThere are four screw holes, one in either corner, which will make it very easy to hang on a wall.  \n\nOverall this radical sign measures 41.75&quot; wide x 21.5&quot; tall x 3/4&quot; deep.

Also, the Placement Line on the side of each stamp makes using our stamps so easy since you can see exactly where each part of the stamped image will go.\r\n\r\nSince our stamps are so deeply etched, they can easily be used on PMC or clay, fabric, wood....just about anywhere!", "tags": ["art", "handmade", "embellishment", "decoration", "peg stamp", "leaf", "stamp", "rubber", "leafgreen", "sage", "botanical", "teamt", "diy"], "price": "3.50", "item_weight": null, "item_width": null, "who_made": "i_did", "category_path_ids": [69150433, 68887752], "file_data": "", "recipient": null, "is_private": false, "category_path": ["Supplies", "Scrapbooking"], "non_taxable": false, "ending_tsz": 1466723655, "is_supply": "true", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://www.etsy.com/listing/64528113/three-veined-leaves-rubber-stamp?utm_source=brendansudol&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api", "when_made": "2010_2016", "materials": ["wood", "rubber"], "item_dimensions_unit": null, "currency_code": "USD", "occasion": null, "category_id": 68887752, "item_weight_units": null, "featured_rank": null, "quantity": 1}, {"num_favorers": 2233, "image": "https://img0.etsystatic.com/012/0/7102594/il_340x270.444896758_rh8h.jpg", "creation_tsz": 1447017112, "taxonomy_id": 891, "style": ["Industrial", "Minimalistisch"], "item_length": null, "has_variations": true, "original_creation_tsz": 1364987362, "shop_section_id": 12610024, "used_manufacturer": false, "listing_id": 128296504, "user_id": 23305061, "processing_min": 5, "title": "Concrete Pendant Light Catherina30, wrinkle", "processing_max": 10, "taxonomy_path": ["Home & Living"], "views": 15612, "last_modified_tsz": 1455159250, "state": "active", "is_digital": false, "shipping_template_id": 144046848, "is_customizable": true, "item_height": null, "state_tsz": 1442926921, "description": "Concrete Pendant Light Catherina 30, wrinkle\r\n\r\nConcrete floating lightly on the ceiling, a rare sight.

I designed this mailbox after the 1950&#39;s black mailbox that used to hang on my house.  I really liked the way it functioned so I used it to inspire this modern mailbox.  The wood gives it some warmth while the thick 14ga Stainless Steel cover protects and makes it sturdy.  It easily attaches to the wall with two keyhole brackets located on the back of the mailbox.  The wood is sealed with a spar urethane exterior grade finish. Interior dimensions are 17&quot;W x 6 3/4&quot;H x 4&quot;D.\n\nThis is a made to order item. It will take 3-4 weeks for the mailbox to ship. \n\nThe mailbox can be laser etched with letters, numbers or graphics. Etching is $20 extra. Please choose the text option in the pull down menu to include etching in your order. At checkout please leave a note letting me know what you would like etched. The fill or inside of the text will be left natural in less otherwise specified. Normally the laser burns slightly making the etching darker depending on the wood type\n\nThe mailbox cover is available in stainless steel, black, red, bronze or white powder coat finish.\n\nIt is recommended that this mailbox be mounted to a wall that has shelter of some kind such as eves, porch or an overhang etc. Exposer to heavy rain is not recommended.  This is because of the small opening along the top of the mailbox that could possibly leak.\n\nI have designed and constructed this mailbox with hardware (ie screws,washers, nuts) rather than welds.  This is because I like knowing that for any reason the mailbox needs fixing your local hardware store has the hardware to replace and fix it (or you can ask me for replacement parts).  But with welded parts it is not as easy to repair.  Everything is stainless steel and should not rust.  The wood box can easily be taken out when or if it ever needs refinishing. \n\nThe image shown is not the actual mailbox that you will receive for this listing. \n\nInternational customers please contact me and I will add your country to the shipping locations.", "tags": ["Teak", "house mounted", "mailbox", "modern mailbox", "wood steel mailbox", "flip down mailbox", "contemporary mailbox", "wood mailbox", "stainless steel mail", "teak mailbox", "modern", "Ce Ce Works", "Laura Rittenhouse"], "price": "375.00", "item_weight": "160", "item_width": "10", "who_made": "i_did", "category_path_ids": [69150425, 68891508, 68900036], "file_data": "", "recipient": "unisex_adults", "is_private": false, "category_path": ["Housewares", "Outdoor", "Garden Decor"], "non_taxable": false, "ending_tsz": 1463194832, "is_supply": "false", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://www.etsy.com/listing/109040590/modern-mailbox-teak-and-stainless-steel?utm_source=brendansudol&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api", "when_made": "made_to_order", "materials": ["Teak", "Stainless Steel"], "item_dimensions_unit": "in", "currency_code": "USD", "occasion": "housewarming", "category_id": 68900036, "item_weight_units": null, "featured_rank": null, "quantity": 3}, {"image": "https://img1.etsystatic.com/000/0/6249551/il_340x270.323975087.jpg", "creation_tsz": 1450485052, "suggested_taxonomy_id": 967, "style": ["Mid Century", "Industrial"], "item_length": null, "has_variations": false, "original_creation_tsz": 1332896808, "shop_section_id": 7962311, "used_manufacturer": false, "listing_id": 96283360, "user_id": 13219149, "processing_min": null, "title": "Rare First Production PAW Rope Edge Elephant Hide Grey Zenith Swivel Eames Chair", "processing_max": null, "taxonomy_path": ["Home & Living", "Furniture"], "num_favorers": 2302, "last_modified_tsz": 1451715889, "state": "sold_out", "is_digital": false, "is_private": false, "shipping_template_id": null, "is_customizable": false, "item_height": null, "state_tsz": 1451715889, "description": ":: Amazing and rare first production / first generation 1949-1950 Zenith Herman Miller Eames chair often called a &quot;PAW chair&quot; with its swivel dowel base made of birch wood, with the fiberglass shell color being in the much sought after + highly collectible color of elephant hide grey.

Proper and careful oiling will likely fully alleviate this. The light and beautiful birch wood dowel base does show age with some markings which as you can see in the photos, does seem to add in a good way to the chair&#39;s awesome vintage look.
